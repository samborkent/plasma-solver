# plasma-solver
Based on 'Numerical modelling of the plasma plume propagation and oxidation during pulsed laser deposition of complex oxide thin films', 2020, by T. Wijnands, E.P. Houwman, G. Koster, G. Rijnders, and M. Huijben. The original script by Tom Wijnands modeled the propagation of an PLD plasma plume in 3D as result of ablation of a single crystal TiO2 target, initial ablation is not included. Modified by Bart Boonstra to improve performance and extended to include two metals (SrTiO3). Refactored and extended by Sam Borkent to improve readability and performance and to include two metals with highly different masses (Li2TiO3).
